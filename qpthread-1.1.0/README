                 ------------------------
		 
Designed and Implemented by Pavel Krauz Copyright (C) 1999
----------------------------------------------------------


Overview
--------
The QpThread Library provides object oriented framework in C++ for threads 
and Unix signals on top of system level threads (currently POSIX Threads). 
Moreover it supports deferred cancellation through C++ exception, timer, 
producent/consumer containers, thread pool and much more. 


Documentation
-------------
Refer to QpThread documentation in README.html file


Instalation
-----------
For Unix platforms refer to INSTALL
For Win NT platform refer to INSTALL.win32


Supported Platforms
-------------------

Linux 2.0,2.2/Intel/Alpha/Sparc		EGCS at least 1.1.2 with GLIBC-2.1.1
Solaris 2.5/Intel/Sparc			SUNWspro 4.2 with STLport-3.12.3
Digital OSF1 4.0/Alpha			DEC C++ 6.0
Windows NT				Visual C++ 6.0

The dependency for architecture specific code was removed so it
should be easier to port it. But the architecture specific code
is still present for better performance and SpinLock feature.
If you do not have the arch specific code simply do not define
-DARCH_TAS in your Makefile.

QpSpinLock is supported on Intel, Alpha and Sparc HW architectures

You are more than welcome to port it to other platforms and/or compilers.
