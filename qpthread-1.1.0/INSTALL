
To install QpThread library for C++ perform following tasks:
Quick Install:

./configure
make    or    make all   for static linked library also
make install


Description:
1. Run ./configure or copy Make.def.base to Make.def and edit Make.def to 
   match your platform (the DEST variable) and your installation directory 
   (the INST_PREFIX variable)
   
   For Solaris SUNWspro 4.2 compiler you need to download STL implementation.
   The QpThread library is supported with STLport-3.12.tgz which is available 
   from http://www.stlport.org or from QpThread archive. Untar STLport-3.XX.tgz
   and set STL_INC variable in Make.def. You will need this STL for QpThread
   further so install it in some common place.
   
2. Make sure you have GNU make installed

3. type make all            (or   gmake all       for GNU make)
   plain make will build only dynamic library

4. type make install        (or   gmake install   for GNU make)

5. optionally you can compile and run some test programs available in ex
   directory
   
enjoy
