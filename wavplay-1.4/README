wavplay-1.4  completely  replaces  wavplay-1.3.  This  release  consists
mostly  of  improvements  provided  by Jonathan Woithe.  There were some
additional small  fixes  applied  to  bring the software up to date with
current  distributions.  This should make it easier for folks to compile
it.

See also the BUGS file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT'S NOT INCLUDED :
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some  of  you  have  asked about compressed formats.  This project still
lacks support for it unfortunately.  I have been busy holding down a job
and  writing  Linux books.  I  had  started GnuWave as a replacement for
wavplay,  but a  general lack of time has prevented me from getting very
far with it. I don't know what the future holds on this.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGES FOR WAVPLAY 1.4 (SINCE WAVEPLAY 1.3) :
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Jonathan  Woithe applied a fix to FilesDlgOKCB()  so it ignored empty
XmStrings  passed  from  the  file  selector dialog when a directory was
selected.

-  Jonathan  Woithe:  fixed  some actions immediately after starting the
program  (eg: setting 8/16  bit sample size)  would not clear all of the
help strings displayed in the File/type/date/size fields.  This has been
fixed.

-  Jonathan  Woithe:  During  record,  the  size, duration and number of
samples is updated as the recording progresses.

- Jonathan Woithe: a time display was added. This allows a user to start
playback  from  any point in the file.  While playing, this display also
tracks  the current position within the file.  The display is calibrated
in 25 fps SMPTE format.

-  Jonathan  Woithe  (24Feb1999):  the  block  size request to the sound
driver  now  follows the setting of sampling rate, sample size etc since
doing it before these are set results in undefined behaviour.

-  Warren  Gay:  fixed  the  annoying  problem  with  union  semun being
undefined. At  one  time it  was  defined by  include  <sys/sem.h>,  but
according  to recent semctl(2)  man page "according to X/OPEN we have to
define it ourselves".  This is now auto-detected at compile time, and so
should still compile on old and new kernels.

-  Warren  Gay: A new -d option was added to the wavplay/wavrec command,
to allow  the  user to override the device pathname on the command line.
This  was suggested  by  Jonathan Woithe and added by me (Jonathan, your
patches talked about it but was missing this code as far as I can tell.)
Jonathan  indicated that this is useful if you have multiple sound cards
installed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGES FOR WAVPLAY 1.3 (SINCE WAVPLAY 1.0) :
------------------------------------------------------------------------

See file NEW for a more complete description.  This release is primarily
a  bug  fix  release, but  does  include  a few small enhancements.  The
primary enhancement to this release is the real time scheduling feature,
which  if  enabled,  can  greatly  improve  the  reliability of wav file
playing  or  recording  (Thanks  to  Dirk  Pfau  pfau@dkrz.de  for  this
suggestion).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
WAVPLAY/WAVREC REQUIREMENTS :
------------------------------------------------------------------------

	- Probably any kernel released as 1.2.13 or later is a safe bet,
	  but real time support requires 2.x.x or later.
	- Requires appropriate and working sound drivers installed

    TESTED ON:

        - egcs-2.91.66
        - Red Hat 6.0
        - Kernel release 2.2.10

------------------------------------------------------------------------
XLTWAVPLAY *ADDITIONAL* REQUIREMENTS :
------------------------------------------------------------------------

	- Mouse
	- Working X Server
	- X based libraries (X, Xt etc.)
	- libXmu.so (unless you uncomment NO_EDITRES option in Makefile)
	- libXm.so (LessTif/or MOTIF)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
HISTORY :
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.4	A  release  mostly  based  upon  Jonathan  Woithe's  fixes  and
	enhancements. I added the -d option and fixed the semun compile
	problem. Minor adjustments to the Makefile also were made.

1.3	Bug fix release, includes 1.0 + 2 patches, and other small
	bug fixes. Added sched_setscheduler() call.

1.0	The  current release, which includes:

	wavplay				Improved
	recplay				Improved
	xltwavplay			MOTIF/LessTif client (new)

0.22	A modification release by Per Harald Myrvang (perm@bigfoot.com)

	In  this  release,  patched  a  few fixes to the problematic WAV
	header  code,  as  well as added options -Q, -i and -D for quiet
	mode, information display only mode, and debug modes.

0.21w1	A   modification   release   by   myself   of  Andre  Fuechsel's
	(af1@irz.inf.tu-dresden.de) work.

	For  the  most part, this release did not change the WAV aspects
	of  the  program,  but merely added semaphore locking facilities
	and made the  program  more shell friendly.  The executable name
	was changed from the original 'play' to 'wavplay'.

	Andre's  Xplay  was  dropped  from  this  release,  since it was
	available in his original work.

0.21	Andre Fuechsel (af1@irz.inf.tu-dresden.de)

	Apparently  a bug fix release for Xplay.  This appears to be the
	first public release.

0.2	Andre Fuechsel (af1@irz.inf.tu-dresden.de)

	According  to  Andre's  README, it was "(not announced)".  Andre
	also notes that:

	"Some  code  comes  from  the  recplay.c written by Liam Corner,
	posted in the 'Audio Utilities for Linux 2.0' - Package."
